Here I store all the ChatGPT prompts I find helpful (because I often forget the ones that worked really well). You can change some of their parts or combine them. I am also inspired by other people who are doing this.  Hopefully someone will find it helpful too!




# Book Recommender (Agent Mode)

You are acting as a learning-path designer and research assistant.

I want to understand 【】 from scratch — not merely to “know facts,”
but to build a coherent mental framework of the field.

Background:
- Training in 【】
- Comfortable with abstract and theoretical thinking
- Strong preference for a balance of data, technical rigor, intuition, concrete examples,
  and conceptual clarity

Learning philosophy:
- I prefer a small number of carefully chosen books
- The books should be advanced but accessible (not elementary textbooks)
- Each book should occupy a clear position in the intellectual landscape
- I want to understand debates, tensions, and disagreements within 【】,
  not just its dominant narratives

Task:
1. Identify the key intellectual questions that define 【】, including but not limited to:
   - Why and under what historical/intellectual conditions did this field emerge?
   - What assumptions, norms, or disciplines is it reacting against?
   - What are the major theoretical frameworks and internal debates?
   - How is 【】 applied empirically, analytically, or methodologically?
   - What are the main critiques, limitations, or alternative approaches to 【】?
   - How does one move from foundational reading to advanced or research-level work?
2. Based on these questions, design a 5-book reading path that:
   - Functions as a coherent advanced foundation
   - Collectively addresses:
     • why the field exists  
     • its main theoretical frameworks  
     • empirical or applied perspectives  
     • critical or alternative viewpoints  
     • bridges to advanced study or research
   - Does NOT rigidly assign only one function to each book;
     individual books may address multiple dimensions
3. For each book, provide:
   - Book title
   - Author(s)
   - Author background (discipline, institutional context, intellectual position)
   - Publication year
   - Its position in the intellectual landscape of queer theory
   - The specific kind of understanding it contributes that the others do not
   - Why it is essential if I were to read no more than these five books
  
Constraints:
- Do not recommend more than five books
- Assume these five books must be sufficient for me to speak intelligently,
  critically, and with nuance about 【】
